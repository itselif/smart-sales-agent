It provides a clear reference to the service's data contracts, business rules, and API structure, helping ensure compatibility and correct integration.



## `StoreManagement` Service Settings [**Edit**](storemanagement/serviceSettings)

Manages retail stores, lifecycle, assignment of users (sellers, managers) to stores, override workflows, isolation enforcement, and supports configuration, selection, listing, and dynamic assignment endpoints.

### Service Overview

This service is configured to listen for HTTP requests on port `3002`, 
serving both the main API interface and default administrative endpoints.

The following routes are available by default:

* **API Test Interface (API Face):** `/`
* **Swagger Documentation:** `/swagger`
* **Postman Collection Download:** `/getPostmanCollection`
* **Health Checks:** `/health` and `/admin/health`
* **Current Session Info:** `/currentuser`
* **Favicon:** `/favicon.ico`

The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `salesai-storemanagement-service`.

This service is accessible via the following environment-specific URLs:

* **Preview:** `https://storeManagement-api-salesai1.prw.mindbricks.com`
* **Staging:** `https://storeManagement-api-salesai1.staging.mindbricks.com`
* **Production:** `https://storeManagement-api-salesai1.prod.mindbricks.com`

                                 

### Authentication & Security
- **Login Required**: Yes

This service requires user authentication for access. It supports both JWT and RSA-based authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user sessions and data integrity.
If a crud route also is configured to require login, 
it will check a valid JWT token in the request query/header/bearer/cookie. If the token is valid, it will extract the user information from the token and make the fetched session data available in the request context.

  
### Service Data Objects
The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `salesai-storemanagement-service`.

Data deletion is managed using a **soft delete** strategy. Instead of removing records from the database, they are flagged as inactive by setting the `isActive` field to `false`.



| Object Name | Description | Public Access | Tenant Level  | 
|-------------|-------------|---------------| --------------| 
| `store` | Represents a retail store location and its properties. Includes lifecycle metadata such as activation status and store-level policy configuration fields. | No |  No | 
| `storeAssignment` | Represents the assignment of a user (seller, manager) to one or more stores. Supports override/temporary assignments, status, and assignment type fields for audit and dynamic access enforcement. | No |  No | 




## store Data Object

### Object Overview
**Description:** Represents a retail store location and its properties. Includes lifecycle metadata such as activation status and store-level policy configuration fields.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. 
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

### Core Configuration
- **Soft Delete:** Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (`isActive = false`) instead of being physically deleted.
- **Public Access:** No — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on route-level rules.
- **Tenant-Level Scope:** No — Enables data isolation per tenant by attaching a tenant ID field.




### Composite Indexes

- **uniqueStoreName**: [name] 
This composite index is defined to optimize query performance for complex queries involving multiple fields.

The index also defines a conflict resolution strategy for duplicate key violations.

When a new record would violate this composite index, the following action will be taken:

**On Duplicate**: `throwError`

An error will be thrown, preventing the insertion of conflicting data.






### Properties Schema

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | String | Yes | Short, human-readable store name (display). |
| `fullname` | String | No | Full/store legal name (used for reporting, invoices, etc). |
| `city` | String | No | The city/location in which this store operates. |
| `avatar` | String | No | Public avatar image URL for the store (branding). |
| `active` | Boolean | Yes | Flag marking this store as currently operational/active. |
* Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.



### Default Values
Default values are automatically assigned to properties when a new object is created, if no value is provided in the request body.
Since default values are applied on db level, they should be literal values, not expressions.If you want to use expressions, you can use transposed parameters in any crud route to set default values dynamically.

- **active**: true



### Auto Update Properties

`name` `fullname` `city` `avatar` `active`

An update crud route created with the option `Auto Params` enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body. 
If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the `Allow Auto Update` option to false.
These properties will be added to the update route's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

 

 

 

### Elastic Search Indexing

`name` `fullname` `city` `active`

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. 
While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.


### Database Indexing

`name`

Properties that are indexed in the database will be optimized for query performance, allowing for faster data retrieval.
Make a property indexed in the database if you want to use it frequently in query filters or sorting.


### Unique Properties

`name`

Unique properties are enforced to have distinct values across all instances of the data object, preventing duplicate entries.
Note that a unique property is automatically indexed in the database so you will not need to set the `Indexed in DB` option.









### Filter Properties

`name` `fullname` `city` `active`

Filter properties are used to define parameters that can be used in query filters, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on user input or predefined criteria.
These properties are automatically mapped as route parameters in the listing CRUD routes that have "Auto Params" enabled.

- **name**: String  has a filter named `name`

- **fullname**: String  has a filter named `fullname`

- **city**: String  has a filter named `city`

- **active**: Boolean  has a filter named `active`





## storeAssignment Data Object

### Object Overview
**Description:** Represents the assignment of a user (seller, manager) to one or more stores. Supports override/temporary assignments, status, and assignment type fields for audit and dynamic access enforcement.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. 
It is defined using the `ObjectSettings` pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

### Core Configuration
- **Soft Delete:** Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (`isActive = false`) instead of being physically deleted.
- **Public Access:** No — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on route-level rules.
- **Tenant-Level Scope:** No — Enables data isolation per tenant by attaching a tenant ID field.




### Composite Indexes

- **uniqueAssignment**: [userId, storeId, assignmentType] 
This composite index is defined to optimize query performance for complex queries involving multiple fields.

The index also defines a conflict resolution strategy for duplicate key violations.

When a new record would violate this composite index, the following action will be taken:

**On Duplicate**: `throwError`

An error will be thrown, preventing the insertion of conflicting data.






### Properties Schema

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `userId` | ID | Yes | ID of the assigned user (references auth.user). |
| `storeId` | ID | Yes | ID of the store this assignment represents. |
| `role` | Enum | Yes | User&#39;s functional role in this store assignment: 0=seller, 1=manager, 2=admin. |
| `assignmentType` | Enum | Yes | Assignment type: 0=normal, 1=override (for temporary/exception access). |
| `status` | Enum | Yes | Assignment status: 0=active, 1=revoked, 2=pending. |
| `overrideJustification` | Text | No | If assignmentType is override, field storing justification for override (if required by policy). |
| `validFrom` | Date | No | The date/time this assignment/override becomes valid. |
| `validUntil` | Date | No | If override, optional date/time until which assignment/override is valid (expiry). |
* Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.




### Constant Properties

`userId` `storeId` `role`

Constant properties are defined to be immutable after creation, meaning they cannot be updated or changed once set. They are typically used for properties that should remain constant throughout the object's lifecycle.
A property is set to be constant if the `Allow Update` option is set to `false`.


### Auto Update Properties

`assignmentType` `status` `overrideJustification` `validFrom` `validUntil`

An update crud route created with the option `Auto Params` enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body. 
If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the `Allow Auto Update` option to false.
These properties will be added to the update route's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

 

### Enum Properties
Enum properties are defined with a set of allowed values, ensuring that only valid options can be assigned to them. 
The enum options value will be stored as strings in the database, 
but when a data object is created an addtional property with the same name plus an idx suffix will be created, which will hold the index of the selected enum option.
You can use the index property to sort by the enum value or when your enum options represent a sequence of values.

- **role**: [seller, manager, admin]

- **assignmentType**: [normal, override]

- **status**: [active, revoked, pending]

 

 

### Elastic Search Indexing

`userId` `storeId` `role` `assignmentType` `status`

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. 
While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.


### Database Indexing

`userId` `storeId` `assignmentType`

Properties that are indexed in the database will be optimized for query performance, allowing for faster data retrieval.
Make a property indexed in the database if you want to use it frequently in query filters or sorting.




### Cache Select Properties

`userId` `storeId`

Cache select properties are used to collect data from Redis entity cache with a different key than the data object id.
This allows you to cache data that is not directly related to the data object id, but a frequently used filter.



### Relation Properties

`userId` `storeId`

Mindbricks supports relations between data objects, allowing you to define how objects are linked together.
You can define relations in the data object properties, which will be used to create foreign key constraints in the database.
For complex joins operations, Mindbricks supportsa BFF pattern, where you can view dynamic and static views based on Elastic Search Indexes.
Use db level relations for simple one-to-one or one-to-many relationships, and use BFF views for complex joins that require multiple data objects to be joined together.

- **userId**: ID
Relation to `user`.id

The target object is a sibling object, meaning that the relation is a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship from this object to the target.

On Delete: Set Null
Required: Yes

- **storeId**: ID
Relation to `store`.id

The target object is a sibling object, meaning that the relation is a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship from this object to the target.

On Delete: Set Null
Required: Yes





### Filter Properties

`userId` `storeId` `role` `assignmentType` `status`

Filter properties are used to define parameters that can be used in query filters, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on user input or predefined criteria.
These properties are automatically mapped as route parameters in the listing CRUD routes that have "Auto Params" enabled.

- **userId**: ID  has a filter named `userId`

- **storeId**: ID  has a filter named `storeId`

- **role**: Enum  has a filter named `role`

- **assignmentType**: Enum  has a filter named `assignmentType`

- **status**: Enum  has a filter named `status`

#### Before DB Command Hook
```javascript
async function beforeDbCommandHook(context, dbCommand) {
  // Intercept before database operation
  // Return modified command or custom response
  return dbCommand;
}
```

#### After DB Command Hook
```javascript
async function afterDbCommandHook(context, result) {
  // Process database operation result
  // Return modified result or throw error
  return result;
}
```

### Edge Function Signature
```javascript
async function edgeFunction(request) {
  // Custom request processing
